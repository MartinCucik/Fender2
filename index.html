            <span class="first-character sc">I</span>"f you were gonna draw an
            electric guitar from your mind's eye, most people would draw a
            Stratocaster as the shape," says Justin Norvell, Fender's Vice
            President of Marketing. "But the thing that connects people to that
            guitar and that shape is the music they grew up on." The
            Stratocaster had a distinctive voice thanks in part to its three
            pickups, the wire-coiled magnets that transmit string vibrations to
            the amplifier. Most electric guitars at that time had one or two.
            Fender also designed a new vibrato â€” the metal arm at the end of the
            strings that allows player to vary their pitch.

            <span class="first-character ny">T</span>he Fender Telecaster,
            colloquially known as the Tele, is an electric guitar produced by
            Fender. Together with its sister model the Esquire, it is the
            world's first mass-produced, commercially successful solid-body
            electric guitar. Its simple yet effective design and revolutionary
            sound broke ground and set trends in electric guitar manufacturing
            and popular music. Like the three-pickup Stratocaster which followed
            it in 1954, the Telecaster is a versatile guitar and has been used
            in many genres, including country, reggae, rock, pop, folk, soul,
            blues, jazz, punk, metal, alternative, indie rock, and R&B. The base
            model has always been available, and other than a change to the
            pickup selector switch configuration, a thinning of the neck, and a
            few variations on the bridge design, it has remained mostly
            unchanged from the 1950s. Several variant models have been produced
            over the years including those with different pickup configurations
            and electronics, semi-hollow body designs, and even a twelve string
            model.

            <span class="first-character atw">I</span>n a guitar world rapidly
            becoming driven towards a standardized quality of guitars
            manufactured in mega factories in China, by the same people who
            build blenders and toaster ovens, consistent top-notch quality is
            getting beyond rare! The knowledge that a Master Builder, someone
            who eats, sleeps, and breathes guitars, built the guitar you wish to
            own is quite a comforting feeling. Beyond just the build, and
            materials, is the sound and tone. Using the best woods, the best
            materials, and the best sounding pickups, you are left with an
            instrument that is quite simply, the best.
